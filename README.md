# CartPole-Solution
 Implementation of Actor Critic to solve the CartPole-v0 environment from OpenAI's gym library. Based on tutorial by Machine Learning with Phil.
 In this project, the performances of agents with neural nets containing 1, 2, or 3 fully connected layers are compared.

### Replicate results
* **[actorCritic.py](https://github.com/Andrade-Diego/CartPole-Solution/blob/master/actorCritic.py)** - contains the implementation of Actor Critic itself, with cases for it being called with 1, 2, or 3, fully connected layers.
* **[driver.py](https://github.com/Andrade-Diego/CartPole-Solution/blob/master/driver.py)** - drives the Agents and graphs their learning rates. This file contains all of the hyperparameters to play around with.
